[![Tests](https://github.com/parripollo/ckanext-api-tracking/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/parripollo/ckanext-api-tracking/actions/workflows/test.yml)
This repository contains a CKAN open-source extension that can be added to any CKAN 2.11+ instance. It was developed by Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) and Open Knowledge Foundation (OKFN).  

# CKAN API tracking extension

This extension allows CKAN portals to monitor the use of API tokens by users or service accounts.  

## Use-cases

NRC uses this extension in the following way:

 - Track API usage by dataset and organization.
 - Track API usage by users.
 - Track API usage by API token.

## How it works

This extension adds a new middleware to the CKAN application that intercept all API requests and log them into the CKAN database. A new database table was created to store this information. This table is similar to the current CKAN `tracking_raw` table (in use at the `TrackingMiddleware`). Considering the similarities with the CKAN core feature, a possible future for this extension is to capture all calls and unify usage tracking.  

This extension also includes a series of dashboards with a summary of the available data. These dashboards are based on the CKAN core `StatsPlugin` plugin. This extension eventually will attempt to replace the current `stats` plugin.  

All data from this extension is only accessible by sysadmins.

See [tracking_type.md](/DOCS/imgs/tracking_type.md) for more information on the tracking fields.

### API endpoints

 - all_token_usage: `/api/action/all_token_usage[?limit=10]` It returns all API requests with a user token. Sort by date.
 - most_accessed_dataset_with_token: `/api/action/most_accessed_dataset_with_token[?limit=10]` It returns the most accessed datasets with a user token. Sort by most requested dataset.
 - most_accessed_token: `/api/action/most_accessed_token[?limit=10]` It returns the most accessed user token. Sort by most used token.
 - users_active_metrics: `/api/action/users_active_metrics[?limit=10]` It returns the most active users. Sort by most active user.

### CSV endpoints

A more _human-readable_ way to access the same API data through CSV files. The following endpoints are available:

 - `/tracking-csv/most-accessed-dataset-with-token.csv`
 - `/tracking-csv/most-accessed-token.csv`
 - `/tracking-csv/all-token-usage.csv`
 - `/tracking-csv/users-active-metrics.csv`

## Requirements

Compatibility with core CKAN versions:

| CKAN version    | Compatible?   |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| 2.10            | Until 0.5.3   |
| 2.11            | Yes           |
| 2.12            | Yes           |
| [PostgreSQL-only CKAN](https://github.com/parripollo/ckanito) | Yes           |


## Installation

To install ckanext-api-tracking:

Install the package:

    pip install -e "git+https://github.com/NorwegianRefugeeCouncil/ckanext-api-tracking.git@main#egg=ckanext-api-tracking"
    pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NorwegianRefugeeCouncil/ckanext-api-tracking/main/requirements.txt

or clone the source and install it on the virtualenv

    git clone https://github.com/NorwegianRefugeeCouncil/ckanext-api-tracking.git
    cd ckanext-api-tracking
    pip install -e .
	pip install -r requirements.txt

Add `api_tracking` to the `ckan.plugins` setting in your CKAN
   config file (by default the config file is located at
   `/etc/ckan/default/ckan.ini`).
It's also required to add the core extenstion `tracking` to the `ckan.plugins` setting.


Restart CKAN.

## Config settings

CKAN has a philosophy where less data collected is better so you'll need to eanble the tracking in the configuration file.  
Ensure tracking only what you need.  

```
ckanext.api_tracking.track_login = true  # default is false
ckanext.api_tracking.track_logout = true # default is false
```
